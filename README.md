The purpose of this roadmap is to structure topics and fill the gaps in knowledge in an organized way. It consists of 5 main sections with their own branches with links to useful resources. The map was created based on my experience, research, and observations on what skills and knowledge are essential for UX/UI Product designers whether you want to be hired or have your own product.
